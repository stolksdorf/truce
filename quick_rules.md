# truce - quick rules

> short version of the Truce rules for fast reference.

### setup
- each player starts with 3 coins
- pick how many rounds that game will be (8 - 15 is good)
- create a center pool with 1 coin, called The Stash

### play
- each round add 1 coin to center pool of coins; The Stash
- each player secretly selects an action. Once selected, each action is revealed at the same time.
- actions:
  - attack [+ target]: Atk val = # of supporters. Attack is successful if Atk val is greater than the target's Def val.
  - defend: Def val = # of supporters. Ties go in favour of Defender.
  - support [+ target]: become a supporter of another player.
  - loot: Split The Stash with other looters into your Spoils. You always lose to attacks.
  - pass: Do nothing.
- if you do not have any coins, you may only select support or pass
- if attack successful, take 1 coin from target + their spoils and put it into your spoils.
- at the end of the round, each player move the coins from their spoils into their supply


### to win
- the player with the most coins at the end of the final round wins. If tie, player with the most supporters that round breaks the tie.


### notes
- always split coins evenly among players, remove the reminder from the game. eg: Split 5 coins between 3 players? Each gets 1 and 2 are lost
- you need support to succeed at attacking and defending.
- if you run out of coins, you are not out of the game. You can still support whoever still has coins. Be careful who you double cross, you might need them in the end game.
- Support gets passed along. If A supports B, and B supports C, then both A & B support C.
