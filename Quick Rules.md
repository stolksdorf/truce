# Truce - quick rules

> short version of the Truce rules for fast reference.

setup

- each player starts with 3 coins
- pick how many rounds that game will be (8 - 15 is good)
- create a center pool with 1 coin, called The Stash

play

- each round add 1 coin to center pool of coins; The Stash
- each player secretly selects an action. Once selected, each action is revealed at the same time.
- actions:
  - attack + target: Attack value = # of supporters. Attack is successful if Atk val is greater than Def val.
  - defend: Defense value = # of supporters. Ties go in favour of Defender.
  - support + target: become a supporter of another player. 
  - loot: Split The Stash with other looters into your Spoils. You lose to Attacks automatically.
  - pass: Do nothing.
- If you do not have any coins, you may only select support or pass
- if attack successful, take 1 coin from target + their spoils into your spoils.
- at the end of the round, each player move Spoils into their Supply



win
- the player with the most coins in the final round wins. If tie, player with the most supporters that round wins.


### Key concepts
- always split coins evenly among players, remove the reminder from the game.
- You need support to succeed at attacking and defending. 
- If every something is shared, it's always split evenly and the reminder is removed from the game. Eg. Split 5 coins between 3 players? Each gets 1 and 2 are lost
- If you run out of coins, you are not out of the game. You can still support whoever still has coins. Be careful who you double cross, you might need them in the end game.
