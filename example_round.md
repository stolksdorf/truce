## Example Round of Truce

We have 6 players: Agatha, Barney, Celeste, Darcy, Emmett, and Freja

Emmett wants to kick off the game aggressively and wants to attack Agatha. They reach out to both Freja and Barney privately asking for support. Both Freja and Barney agree to support, but Barney plans to not follow through.

Barney tells Agatha of Emmett's attack and convinces her that she should defend and he will support her, simply asking that the favor be returned later in the game. She agrees, but Barney is planning to deceive her as well. Instead, he plots with Darcy, that they should attack Emmett and split the winnings.

Celeste decides to stay out of the scheming for this round. Seeing that everyone is busy and the Stash is at 2 coins, she decides to pick `Loot` thinking that no one else will.

Each player submits their actions secretly and are revealed at the same time.


| Player | Action | Target |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Agatha | Defend | -- |
| Barney | Attack | Emmett |
| Celeste| Loot | -- |
| Darcy | Support| Barney |
| Emmett | Attack | Agatha |
| Freja | Support| Emmett |


### Resolution
- Celeste successfully Loots, gaining the entire Stash (2 coins) into her Spoils.
- Agatha Defends, but with no supporters, her defense value is 0
- Emmett's attack on Agatha is successful, his attack value is 1 (from Freja's Support). He takes 1 of Agatha's coins into his Spoils
- Barney's attack is also successful, since his attack value is 1 (from Darcy's support), and Emmett's defense is 0 since he attacked. Barney takes all of Emmett's Spoils (1 coin) and 1 coin from Emmett's supply.
- Once everything is resolved, Barney keeps his word and gives 1 coin to Darcy which goes into her Spoils for the next round, potentially making her a target.
