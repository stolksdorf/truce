# Truce

> A game of subterfuge, co-operation, and above all, diplomacy

Truce is a zero-sum social game, where everyone is against you, but you need other's help to make your actions are successful. It's a streamlined version of the popular, but daunting, [Diplomacy](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy). Truce removes the pieces and map, simplifies the interactions, and adds a jockeying element of the taking the stash. This makes it much easier to teach, and is possible to play remotely via correspondence without sacrificing the scheming and backstabbing.
